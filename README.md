# üìö Library Management System

A comprehensive Java-based Library Management System that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming principles, Collections Framework, and console-based user interaction.

## üåü Features

- **Book Management**: Add, view, and manage library catalog
- **Borrowing System**: Borrow and return books with due date tracking
- **Search Functionality**: Search books by title with partial matching
- **Availability Tracking**: Real-time book availability status
- **Due Date Management**: Automatic due date calculation (2 weeks from borrow date)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive console menu system

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java 8+**: Core programming language
- **Collections Framework**: HashMap for efficient book storage, HashSet for borrowed books tracking
- **Java Time API**: LocalDate for due date management
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes, encapsulation, and abstraction


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or text editor
- Terminal/Command Prompt

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PixelDev-Vic/Library-Management-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd library-management-system
   ```

3. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac LibrarySystem.java
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java LibrarySystem
   ```

## üíª Usage

When you run the application, you'll see an interactive menu:

```
üìö Welcome to Library Management System!

=== MENU ===

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Classes

#### `Book` Class
- **Attributes**: ISBN, title, author, availability status, due date
- **Methods**: Borrow book, return book, getters/setters
- **Features**: Automatic due date calculation, status management

#### `Library` Class
- **Data Structures**: 
  - `HashMap<String, Book>` for efficient book lookup by ISBN
  - `HashSet<String>` for tracking borrowed books
- **Methods**: Add book, display catalog, borrow/return operations, search functionality
- **Features**: Pre-loaded sample data, comprehensive book management

#### `LibrarySystem` Class (Main)
- **Responsibilities**: User interface, input handling, application flow control
- **Features**: Interactive menu system, input validation, user-friendly prompts

## üîß Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Abstraction**: Clean separation of Book and Library responsibilities
- **Method Design**: Single responsibility principle in method implementation

### Data Structures & Collections
- **HashMap**: O(1) book lookup by ISBN for efficient searching
- **HashSet**: Fast borrowed books tracking and lookup
- **ArrayList**: Dynamic storage for multiple data types

### Java Features
- **Java 8 Time API**: Modern date handling with LocalDate
- **String Formatting**: Professional output formatting
- **Exception Safety**: Null-safe operations and validation

## üìä Sample Data

The system comes pre-loaded with popular programming books:

| ISBN | Title | Author |
|------|-------|--------|
| 978-0134685991 | Effective Java | Joshua Bloch |
| 978-0596009205 | Head First Design Patterns | Eric Freeman |
| 978-0132350884 | Clean Code | Robert Martin |
| 978-0201633610 | Design Patterns | Gang of Four |
